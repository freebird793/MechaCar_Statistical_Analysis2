# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis2

Deliverable 1
The linear regression analysis effectively predicts the MPG to MechaCar prototypes with an R-squared of .7149. While it is not a perfect indicator at the moment, being that it is only running a 71% accuracy rate, there are other outside factors that could be added to the model in order to increase its accuracy.

Deliverable 2
The current variance from our "total_summary" table does not meet the dealer's specifications because it is 62.29. Lots 1&2 were within the manufacturer's specifications, while lot 3 was an outlier with 170.29, which was above the manufacturer's specification of 100 PSI.
